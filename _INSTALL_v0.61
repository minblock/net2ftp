Requirements
------------
- Web server: 	any web server which can run PHP. The most popular one is Apache
- PHP:        	at least version 4. net2ftp works under safemode
- Disk space: 	150kB for net2ftp, and a few MB for the temporary files


Installation steps
------------------
1 - Unzip all the files on your computer, and upload them to your server.
2 - The /temp directory should be chmodded to 777 (you can use www.net2ftp.com 
    to do this).
3 - Set your settings in the settings.inc.php file.
4 - A database is only required if you want to log the actions of the users. To 
    create the tables, execute the SQL queries in the "create_tables.sql" file. 
    This can be done easily in PhpMyAdmin -- the popular front-end to MySQL.

Done !


Additional steps
----------------
* Protect the /temp and the /admin directories. To do this, create 
  .htaccess and .htpasswd files.
* In your php.ini file, register_globals can be set to "off" (this is more 
  secure), but the application will off course also work if it is set to "on".
* The files are transmitted using mode FTP_ASCII by default. 
  There is a list of file extensions (zip, doc, ...) which are transmitted 
  by FTP_BINARY.

NOTE: IF YOUR SERVER RUNS WINDOWS
---------------------------------
There is a bug in the implementation of PHP on Windows: the ftp_rawlist and 
ftp_nlist functions do not work. As net2ftp heavily needs these functions,
the application will not work properly either.

The user can log in, but the list of directories and files is empty.
(The exact same function works well under Linux, Unix, and BSD.)

I am not sure if this bug has been solved in recent versions of PHP.
