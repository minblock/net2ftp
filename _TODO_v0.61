NEW FEATURES
------------

* Multi-lingual support

* Apache/MySQL specific tools: password-protect directories, custom error pages, 
  run SQL queries

* Upload progress bar

* Show thumbnails for gif, jpg and png files

* Send/receive files by mail

* Search files for given string

* One-time passwords

* Client-side encryption with javascript

* Make FTP files available via HTML link, like for example: 
  <img src="http://www.net2ftp.com/getfile.php?ftpserver=ftp.myserver.com&file=/home/david/mypicture.jpg">

* Add compression of the HTML output, if the browser supports it.
  This should do the trick: ob_start("ob_gzhandler")

* Sign a file (MD5)

* There is a function that maps the FTP server and directory, to the WEB (HTTP)
  server and directory.

  It is used on the Browse screen, when a user clicks on the filename, a new 
  window opens in which that file is executed from its WEB (not FTP) server.

  This function works perfectly if a domain name is used 
  (eg ftp.mysite.com/dir/file.php is mapped to http://www.mysite.com/dir/file.php). 
  However, this function has to be adapted on a case-by-case basis for most free 
  hosts, because the mapping is different for each host.
  Some examples:
       ftp.freeserver.com/username/dir/file.php       can be mapped to   
       
       http://username.freeserver.com/dir/file.php
       http://www.freeserver.com/username/dir/file.php
       http://freeusers.freeserver.com//~username/dir/file.php
  On the homepage, there should be a note for this, both for the users of free 
  webhosts, and for the free webhosts, which would like their FTP server to be 
  reachable using net2ftp

* Install script

* Bug report specifications for forum


BUGS & TECHNICAL ISSUES
-----------------------

* The user Urban reported a problem with symlinks: relative symlinks work, but 
  absolute ones not. When investigating this, it appeared that there are 
  symlinks to directories, and symlinks to files. The problem is that a 
  ftp_rawlist request does not show any difference... no solution yet.
  
  This can be tested on the public server ftp.belnet.be with username 
  anonymous and password test@test.com -- any volunteers?

* Solve the problem that slower FTP sites cannot be reached sometimes with 
  net2ftp. This function may help: ftp_set_option(FTP_TIMEOUT_SEC)
